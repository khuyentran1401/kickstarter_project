# Guessing Game
Test your judgement by deciding whether a project will reach its goal
## Background: 
[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is an American public benefit corporation that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity. As of December 2019, Kickstarter has received more than $4.6 billion in pledges from 17.2 million backers to fund 445,000 projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology, publishing, and food-related projects. People who back Kickstarter projects are offered tangible rewards or experiences in exchange for their pledges.

Project creators choose a deadline and a minimum funding goal. If the goal is not met by the deadline, no funds are collected

## Objective: 
A project can be successful or failed. If the project did not reach its goal by the deadline, it is considered a failed project. In this game, you will use the information provided about a project to decide whether it will be successful or not. You can look up hints that contain the information and outcome of other projects in order to guess the outcome of your chosen project. Have fun!
